Experimenting with tailwind and the remix framework to create a portfolio website.

This project uses tailwind for CSS
REMIX front/backend


22/12/21 - Update. Exploring remix was cool, it definitely has some nice features. However this project doesnt communicate with a database at all nor have use for much if its features. I linked it to a mongodb database before I realised I am literally not handling any data LOL. As of today, its quite tricky using three js and react-three-fiber packages with remix, so I've decided to move this project over to a normal react App in order to render my cute Wall-E model.
